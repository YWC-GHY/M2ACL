# TDSAM Visualization
In the original  paper, we highlighted that TDSAM is capable of correlating essential object information across adjacent frames. In this section, we present visualization results to illustrate this capability. Stay tuned for updates on the advancement of our research. If the paper is accepted, we plan to release both our code and visualization tools simultaneously.
